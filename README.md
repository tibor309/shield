# 🛡️ Shield
Shield is a basic moderation discord bot that helps keepig your server clean. You can kick, ban, softban members, manage roles/chat, and a few more.

>[!Warning]
> This project has been deprecated, because I'm moving to discord.py. You can still run the bot, and most of the commands work just fine.

## Setup
### Replit and Glitch
First clone the repo with the buttons on top, or manually on the site. Then head over to the secrets tab, and create a new secret called `TOKEN`, and place your bot token in the value field. After that just install the packages, and you're done! Make sure the package manager won't install discord.py or other discord libraries!

### Source
Clone the repo, and run the command below to install all the packages.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create a secrets file, and set your bot token. After that, run the command below to run the bot. At least python 3.10 is required!

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Configuration
You can customize the bot to your liking in the config file.
