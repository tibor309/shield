## Setup
### Replit and Glitch
First clone the repo with the buttons on top, or manually on the site. Then head over to the secrets tab, and create a new secret called `TOKEN`, and place your bot token in the value field. After that just install the packages, and you're done! Make sure the package manager won't install discord.py or other discord libraries!

### Source
Clone the repo, and run the command below to install all the packages. Then create a secrets file, and set your bot token. After that, just run it somewhere, or change the configuration in the config file.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
You can customize the bot to your liking in the config file.
